If you would like to add to this repository, please open a PR by either forking
the repo first or, if you're an active member of Portland Has Skill, hit me up
and I can add you as a Collaborator ðŸ˜¸

In general, please:

  - Follow the existing style and conventions

  - Feel free to add to the "Links to Topics Discussed", "Project Sharing" and
    "Companies Using FP in Portland" sections if you are an active member of
    Portland Has Skill

  - Feel free to add to the "Companies Using FP in Portland" section if you
    are associated with a company that uses functional programming in Portland
    that would appreciate our visibility. Please consider attending an event or
    reaching out to say hi!

  - Add discussion links under the appropriate sub-sections. If a sub-section
    doesn't exist, feel free to add it, but see the rest of this document for
    caveats

  - When adding links from the most recent event, add links to the headers of
    the sections updated to the top of the "Links to Topics Discussed" section

  - Be respectful in all interactions with and within this community. If in
    doubt about your conduct, use the [Haskell Foundations Guidelines For
    Respectful Communication](https://haskell.foundation/guidelines-for-respectful-communication/)
    as a guide

If you follow the guidelines above, your PR will likely be quickly accepted
without any discussion or edits. If your PR simply adds to the aforementioned
sections but doesn't quite match up with my expectations, I'll likely just edit
and merge it without discussion. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR CODE EDITED BEFORE
MERGING, PLEASE NOTE THAT IN YOUR PR.

If you create a new section to the discussion links, I may either ask whether
it would fit better in an existing section or simply move and merge it without
discussion. If your PR goes outside these guidelines and you haven't discussed
it with me first (which is optional), I'll likely take some time to consider
it, discuss it with you, and/or ask for feedback from the community before
merging. If I quickly see the obvious benefit of a more substantial PR, I may
merge it quickly without discussion.

Thank you for being a part of our community! ðŸ’™
